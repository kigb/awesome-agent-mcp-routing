## 🔍 What is MCP Tool Routing?

**MCP Tool Routing** refers to the mechanism through which a language model-based agent decides *which* tool to call and *how*, based on task context, prior interactions, and tool capabilities. It is a core component of autonomous and semi-autonomous agents, enabling:

- Dynamic tool selection
- Multi-tool chaining
- Cost-accuracy tradeoff management
- API/tool grounding and argument inference
